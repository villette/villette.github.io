    - On a more personal note, I would say that I'm a big fan of all kind of sports, and especially rugby, which I've been practicing since my teenage years.
    - When I'm not exercising, I enjoy the occasional video game, or watching movies and TV shows of a wide range of genres, from fantasy to comedy, or even sci-fi.
    - I also love to travel, discover the world, new foods and cultures, meeting new people and making new experiences.
